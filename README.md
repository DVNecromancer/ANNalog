This is the ANNalog model, a seq2seq model which could generate 'similar' molecules.
Use seq2seq_environment.yml file to create the conda environment, those are the necessary packages, might need to install more for jupyter notebooks.
Unzip the testing dataset to get some pairs of molecules for quick testing, but you can always input your own molecule!
This package provides the model checkpoint file and the vocab files for testing, the training code is not uploaded yet.

if you are using command lines to generate SMILES, then please use cmd_generation.py you can write one command with necessary files and your input SMILES.
